<p><b>BTS </b>(Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.The septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.<br><br>With positive messages of self-confidence, intricacies of philosophy hidden in their sparkly songs, true synergy and brotherhood in every step of their elaborate choreography, and countless charitable and anthropological endeavors, BTS have put their 14 best feet forward as role models to millions of adoring fans and anyone else who finds themselves drawn to BTS’s undeniable allure.<br>They helped people who are suffering from depression by raising their voices in the form of their songs.<br>Their songs are very inspirational,groovy and catchy and are relatable to youth and other people.<br><br>
One of the most famous causes BTS has actively been a part of is their anti-violence campaign with <b>UNICEF</b>. Through the BTS <b>Love Myself</b> campaign, the band joins UNICEF Korea to #EndViolence against children and teenagers, with the hope of making the world a better place through their music. Their campaign has not only brought greater awareness of the need to protect young people suffering against violence, but it has also inspired the ARMY to get involved and donate to their cause as well. As of November 2018, the campaign has officially raised $1.4 million in total (1.6 billion KRW). The money donated to the cause came from direct donations of the ARMY, as well as a portion of sales from the band’s ‘Love Yourself’ album series. Donations towards the Love Myself campaign were also out of the members’ own earnings as well.<br><br>
The band has inspired fans not only through their good deeds, but in their own personal lives as well. Fans not only from the UK, but worldwide, have expressed how much BTS and their music has helped them.<br><br>
Not just the songs which they produce are amazing but indeed they have amazing personalities.<br>They have been mentioned as <b>The Most Influential People Times </b>both in 2019 and 2020.<br><br><br>
<h3>During her appearance on the Zach Sang Show, their friend and music artist Halsey shared about ARMY’s showing their appreciation to her by donating to charities in her name. To sum up the impact BTS and ARMY have made together, I would like to quote this portion of her interview:<br>
</h3></p>
<p id="text"><h3>“Why isn’t everyone’s fans doing this? Can you imagine if everyone’s fans thanked them by organising charities in their name? What a better place this world would be.”</h3></p>
